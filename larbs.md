Use vim keys `(h/j/k/l)` to navigate this document. Pressing `s` will fit it to
window width (`a` to revert). `K` and `J` zoom in and out. `Super+f` to toggle
fullscreen. `q` to quit. `/` to search for text. (These are general binds set
for zathura, the pdf reader.)

- `Mod+F1` will show this document at any time.
- By `Mod`, I mean the `Super` Key, usually known as “the Windows Key.”

FAQs are at the end of this document.


## Basic goals and principles of this system:
- Naturalness – Remove the border between mind and matter: everything important should be as few keypresses as possible away from you, and you shouldn’t have to think about what you’re doing. Immersion.
- Economy – Programs should be simple and light on system resources and highly extensible. Because of this, many are terminal or small ncurses programs that have all the magic inside of them.
- Keyboard/vim-centrality – All terminal programs (and other programs) use vim keys when possible. Your hands never need leave the home row or thereabout.
- Decentralization – This system is a web of small, modifiable and replaceable programs that users can easily customize.

## General keyboard changes
- Capslock is a useless key in high quality space. It’s now remapped. If you press it alone, it will function as escape, making vimcraft much more natural, but you can also hold it down and it will act as another Windows/super/mod key. 
- The menu button (usually between the right Alt and Ctrl) is an alternative Super/Mod button. This is to make one-handing on laptops easier.

If you’d like to change any of these keyboard changes, you need only open and
change the remaps script. All custom scripts in LARBS are located in
`~/.local/bin/`. Actually, this should go without saying, but everything here
can easily be changed. Below in this document, there is information about where
to change programs/components.

Additionally, while this isn’t a part of the desktop environment, the default
editing mode in the shell is using vi bindings. If you want to learn more of
this, run `Mod+F2` and type and select the option for “vi mode in shell”. This
setting can be changed if you don’t like it by deleting or commenting out the
contents of `~/.config/shell/inputrc`.

## The Status Bar
To the left, you’ll see the numbers of your current workspace/tag(s). On the
right, you’ll see various system status notifiers, the date, volume, even music
and local weather if possible, etc. Each module on the right of the statusbar
is a script located in `~/.local/bin/statusbar/`. You can see what they do and
modify them from there. I’m sure you can figure it out. You can also right
click on the module to see what it does.

The program dwmblocks is what is run to generate the statusbar from those
scripts. You can edit its config/source code in `~/.local/src/dwmblocks/` to
tell it what scripts/commands you want it to display.

## HiDPI and 4K Displays
If you have a screen with a very high dots-per-inch, the interface,
particularly the status bar at the top may be very small. To change this, you
can run `xrandr --dpi 96, replacing 96` with a higher number, then you can
refresh the window manager in the menu at super+backspace. To make this change
persistent after reboot, edit `~/.xprofile` and you will see that same command
which you can change to have the dots-per-inch value you want.

## Deeper Tutorials
Press `mod+F2` at any time to get a menu of programs to watch videos about
streaming directly from YouTube. You can also check the config files for
programs which detail a lot of the specific bindings.


## Key Bindings
The window manager dwm abstractly orders all of your windows into a stack from most impor-
tant to least based on when you last manipulated it. dwm is an easy to use window manager, but
you should understand that it makes use of that stack layout. If you’re not familiar, I recommend
you press `Mod+F2` and select the “dwm” option to watch my brief tutorial (note that the bindings
I discuss in the video are the default dwm binds, which are different (inferior) to those here).
Notice also the case sensitivity of the shortcuts* , Be sure you play around with these. Be
flexible with the basic commands and the system will grow on you quick.

## Recording
I use maim and ffmpeg to make different recordings of the desktop and audio.
All of these recording shortcuts will output into `~`, and will not overwrite
previous recordings as their names are based on their exact times.
- `PrintScreen` – Take a screenshot
- `Shift+PrintScreen` – Select area to screenshot
- `Mod+PrintScreen` – Opens dmenu menu to select kind of audio/video recording
- `Mod+Delete` – Kills any recording started in the above way.
- `Mod+Shift+c` – Toggles a webcam in the bottom right for screencasting.
- `Mod+ScrollLock` – Toggle screenkey (if installed) to show keypresses

## Other buttons
I’ve mapped those extra buttons that some keyboards have (play and pause
buttons, screen brightness, email, web browsing buttons, etc.) to what you
would expect.

## Configuration
Dotfiles/settings files are located in `~/.config/`.

Suckless programs, dwm (the window manager), st (the terminal) and dmenu among
others do not have traditional config files, but have their source code
location in `~/.local/src/` (press `rr` to jump to that directory). There you
can modify their *config.h* files or other source code, then sudo make install
to reinstall.

vim is set to automatically recompile and install these programs whenever you
save changes to any config.h file (compilation will be nearly instantaneous).
You’ll have to restart the program to see its effects obviously.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

> My keyboard isn’t working as expected!

As mentioned above, LARBS makes some keyboard changes with the remaps script.
These settings may override your preferred settings, so you should open this
file and comment out troublesome lines if you have issues.

> My audio isn’t working!

On fresh install, the Linux audio system often mutes outputs. You may also need
to set your preferred default output sink which you can do by the command line,
or by selecting one with *pulsemixer* `(Mod+F4)`.

> How do I copy and paste?

Copying and pasting is always program-specific on any system. In most graphical
programs, copy and paste will be the same as they are on Windows: `ctrl-c` and
`ctrl-v`. In the Linux terminal, those binds have other more important purposes,
so you can run man st to see how to copy and paste in my terminal build.

Additionally, I’ve set vim to use the clipboard as the default buffer, which
means when you yank or delete something in vim, it will be in your system
clipboard as well, so you can `ctrl-v` it into your browser instance, etc. You
can also paste material copied from other programs into vim with the typical
vim bindings.

> How do I change the background/wallpaper?

The system will always read the file `~/.local/share/bg` as the wallpaper. The
*script setbg*, if run on an image will set it as the persistent background. When
using the file manager, you can simply hover over an image name and type `b` and
this will run setbg.

> How I change the colorscheme?

LARBS no longer deploys *Xresources* by default, but check
`~/.config/x11/xresources` for a list of color schemes you can activate or add
your own. When you save the file, vim will automatically update the
colorscheme. If you’d like these colors activated by default on login, there is
a line in `~/.config/x11/xprofile` you can uncomment to allow that. 

Or, if you want to use *wal* to automatically generate colorschemes from your
wallpapers, just install it and setbg will automatically detect and run it on
startup and wallpaper change.


> How do I set up my email?

LARBS comes with mutt-wizard, which gives the ability to receive and send all your email and
keep an offline store of it all in your terminal, without the need for browser. You can add email
accounts by running `mw -a your@email.com`. See man mw for all the information you
need about mutt-wizard.

Once you have successfully added your email address(es), you can open your mail with
neomutt which is also bound to `Mod+e`. You can sync your mail by pressing `Mod+F8` and you
can set a cronjob to sync mail every 10 minutes by running `mw -t 10`.

You may also want to install *pam-gnupg-git*, which can be set up to automatically
unlock your GPG key on login, which will allow you avoid having put in a password to sync and
send, all while keeping your password safe and encrypted on your machine.

> How do I set up my music?

By default, mpd, the music daemon assumes that `~/Music` is your music directory. This can be
changed in `~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf`. When you add music to your music folder, you
may have to run *mpc* up in the terminal to update the database. *mpd* is controlled by *ncmpcpp*,
which is accessible by `Mod+m`.

> How do I update LARBS?

LARBS is deployed as a git repository in your home directory. You can use it as such to fetch,
diff and merge changes from the remote repository. If you don’t want to do that or don’t know
how to use git, you can actually just rerun the script (as root) and reinstall LARBS and it will
automatically update an existing install if you select the same username. This will overwrite the
original config files though, including changes you made for them, but this is an easier brute
force approach that will also install any new dependencies.
